When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all of your local work?

I would want to create a remote repository to allow other users to access, clone, and edit files from the repository on their own working directories. Also, it allows me to collaborate with other users and share progress or changes that I have committed.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might always want to pull changes manually because you may want to pull changes at a time that is a good reference point, such as sensible logical changes have been made. If they were automatically updated, this could jeopardize working with a group, especially if you later decided that one of the changes that you've made is not what you actually want. You wouldn't want to have changes pulled to the remote that you were not ready to pull.
